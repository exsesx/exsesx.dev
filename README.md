# Snowpack Demo

Meet Snowpack.

It's basically the same [my portfolio site](https://github.com/exsesx/exsesx.github.io) (which was recently built with [Next.js]() its `next export` feature), but now it uses [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) instead.

Maybe I'll use this code for my portfolio and archive the old repository. We'll see.
